# Single_Server_Queing_System_Simulation

The program's main goal is to simulate the behavior of the queueing system over time and analyze performance metrics such as average waiting time, system utilization, and queue length. This theme is common in many fields, including operations research, computer systems, telecommunications, and manufacturing, where understanding and optimizing the performance of queueing systems is essential.
